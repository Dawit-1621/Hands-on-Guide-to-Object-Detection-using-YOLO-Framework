## Hands on Guide to Object Detection suing YOLO framework
The YOLO framework (You Only Look Once)
It takes the entire image in a single instance and predicts the bounding box coordinates and class probabilities for these boxes. The biggest advantage of using YOLO is its superb speed – it’s incredibly fast and can process 45 frames per second. YOLO also understands generalized object representation.
