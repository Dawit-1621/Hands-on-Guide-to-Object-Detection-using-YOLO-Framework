## Hands on Guide to Object Detection suing YOLO framework
The YOLO framework (You Only Look Once).
It takes the entire image in a single instance and predicts the bounding box coordinates and class probabilities for these boxes. The biggest advantage of using YOLO is its superb speed – it’s incredibly fast and can process 45 frames per second. YOLO also understands generalized object representation.

YOLO algorithm employs convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect objects in real-time. 
## Installation

!wget https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v3_optimal/yolov4.weights

## How does the YOLO Framework Function?
YOLO first takes an input image:<br>

<br>
The framework then divides the input image into grids (say a 3 X 3 grid):<br>

<br>
Image classification and localization are applied on each grid. YOLO then predicts the bounding boxes and their corresponding class probabilities for objects
